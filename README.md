# Javascript Pro Project

This repository contains code and materials related to a project-based course titled "Become a JavaScript Pro with These 7 Skills" on Coursera. The course covers essential JavaScript concepts, including function expressions and callbacks, the Document Object Model (DOM), jQuery, array iteration, object-oriented JavaScript, and promises.

The course includes the following tasks:

Task 1 - Introduction and user interface orientation

Task 2 - Function expressions and callbacks

Task 3 - Document Object Model (DOM)

Task 4 - jQuery

Task 5 - Iterate arrays like a pro

Task 6 - Object-oriented JavaScript

Task 7 - Mastering Promises

The course was completed successfully, and a certificate of completion is included in this repository. Please note that part of the code was written by following the advice of the instructor, Mr. Harrison Kong, and I do not own the entire code.
